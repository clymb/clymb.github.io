                            <li>On the welcome screen (project-list dashboard), click on <b>Get Started</b>.</li>
                            <li>Give your project a code name. Ex: Project Mayhem
                            <p><i>Tip:</i> New projects are randomly color-coded for identification. If you don't like the color assigned to the project, just go back to the project-list dashboard and click on <b>Get Started</b> again. Repeat if needed.</p></li>
                            <li>Set-up the main goal of the project. What do you want to achieve when the project is done?</li>
                            <li>Click on <b>Add task</b> to add necessary steps to achieve your goal. Click on <b>‚®Å</b> symbol next to each step to add sub-steps. Click on <b>Reorder</b> on the top-right corner to reorder your project tasks or steps. Click on <b>Done</b> when you're done re-arranging.<p><i>Tip:</i> Just write down every small task that needs to be done one-by-one. Don't worry too much about the order of the steps required. You can re-order them later.</p></li>
                            <li>Swipe left to delete any steps you don't need.<p><i>Note:</i> You can't delete tasks with sub-tasks in it directly. You have to delete all the sub-tasks first to delete the main task.</p></li>
                            <li>Add <b>End Date<sup>*</sup></b> to each task. You have to type this in manually for each task and this is intentional. Manual input helps in two things, you'll remember the end dates  better and you can also be creative in how you use it.
                              <p>For example: A "project" can also be a simple "To-do-list" and the End Date could be the order number of items (like 0, 1, 2.. etc) or a specific time (like 8.30 am, 10.30 am, etc) during the day . </p>
                            <p>Example 2: In a team project, you can also use the End Date field to add Member Names responsible for a specific task. The End Date would be optional in this case.</p></li>
                            <li>Take a "top-down" approach to tasks. When you <b>Add task</b>, it is automatically added to the top of task list. So when you re-order tasks, arrange them so that the first task that needs to be done is at the bottom and the last one closer to the goal.</li>
                            <li>Click on <a href="#team">Team</a> to add your team members. This is optional. You can also add members later.</li>
                            <li>Click on <a href="#rewards">Rewards</a> to set-up rewards on completion of the project. This is also optional, you can add these later.</li>
                            <li>Click on <b>Finish</b>. Hurray! you've just set-up your first project!<p><i>Note 1:</i> If you've added team members, you'll be prompted to send "Email Invites" first and then the project is created. In case, you cancel or skip this, you can always <b>re-send invites</b> to added team members again later when you're editing the project.</p>
                            <p><i>Note 2:</i> Team members will not be able to participate in the project unless they click on the invite link received via your email invite.</p></li><br>
                            <p><b><sup>*</sup>Important:</b> Clymb app <u>does not send reminders</u> on <b>End Dates</b> for goals, tasks or sub-tasks. They are merely for your reference. The intention is to shift your focus away from the deadlines and more towards your work. The app, however, does send <b>daily reminders</b> to motivate you to work on your project and update your progress. So don't worry too much about deadlines. Stay busy.</p>

		            <br><strong>Purchasing the subscription</strong>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click on the ‚öôÔ∏è icon on the main screen (project-list dashboard) to view the Settings screen.</li>
                        <li>Click on <b>Manage Subscription</b>. Depending on your region, a <b>Monthly</b> subscription plan will be displayed in your local currency.</li>
                        <li>Move the slider in the Monthly plan row from left to right to make the Purchase. You will be notified once the purchase is successful or if the purchase has failed for some reason. The slider will remain in the active state until you cancel your subscription.</li>
                        <li>Upon successful purchase, you will be able to add or edit projects as necessary. Your subscription will also <u>auto-renew</u> automatically every month and your card will be charged 24 hours before the current subscription period ends.</li>
                        <p><b>Important:</b> You <u>cannot</u> cancel your auto-renewable subscription directly in the app. You will have to do that only through your account settings in iTunes. Move your active slider in your Monthly subscription plan from right to left and you'll be re-directed to your iTunes account. You can then proceed to cancel the subscription from there if you wish. Please note that you will have to cancel your subscription at least 24 hours prior to your current subscription period (check your iTunes account settings).</p>
