EFFECTIVE DATE: JUNE 18, 2019
</h4>
<br>
<p>
Clymb,(“Clymb,” "I" “we,” “our”) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration, and organizational tools available online, including via a mobile application (collectively, the “Service”), and websites, including but not limited to www.clymbapp.com, blog.clymbapp.com, (the “Websites”). Clymb, is headquartered at Bangalore, India. If you have any questions about these User Terms of Service (the “Terms”), please email us at support@clymbapp.com. Clymb has three different types of users depending on the Clymb products used:
</p>
<p>
We call users of the Websites “Site Visitors.”
We call users who use the free version of the Clymb Service “Free Users.” While Free Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers.
We call users who use the Service as part of a paid Clymb subscription plan (regardless of the subscription tier) “Subscribers.” The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier and the specific terms agreed to between Clymb and the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person, called the “Customer”) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (the “Customer Agreement”).
We refer to these three types of users collectively as “Users” or “you” for purposes of these Terms. Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legal agreement directly between you and Clymb and explain the rules governing use of the Service and Websites. By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Service and Websites. We may, from time to time, modify these Terms. Please check this page periodically for updates. We will comply with applicable local legal obligations to provide you with notice of changes to these Terms. Your continued use of the Service and Websites after any such update constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
</p>
<p>
1. ELIGIBILITY AND SCOPE
</p>
<p>
1.1 General. To use the Service and Websites you must be, and represent and warrant that you are, at least 13 years of age and competent to agree to these Terms. If Clymb has previously prohibited you from accessing or using the Service and Websites, you are not permitted to access or use the Service and Websites. 1.2 Location. These Terms are applicable to Users outside of the United States. If you are located in the United States, the terms available at https://clymbapp.com/disclaimer apply to you.
</p>
<p>
2. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND USE
</p>
<p>
2.1 Account Registration and Confidentiality. To access the Service and Websites, you must register for an Clymb account by creating a user name and password. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and current registration information about yourself. It is your responsibility to ensure that your password remains confidential and secure. By registering, you agree that you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password. We may assume that any communications we receive under your account have been made by you. If you are a billing owner, an administrator, or if you have confirmed in writing that you have the authority to make decisions on behalf of a Customer (“Account Administrator”), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to make decisions on behalf of the Customer and agree that Clymb is entitled to rely on your instructions.

Clymb will not be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or attorneys’ fees that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have or have not advised us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred by Clymb or a third party due to someone else using your account. In the event that the Account Administrator or Customer loses access to an account or otherwise requests information about an account, Clymb reserves the right to request from the Account Administrator or Customer any verification it deems necessary before restoring access to or providing information about such account in its sole discretion.
